### This is the README for my Graphics project, which includes details about the game.

####Elements of the game:

- Random balls

####How to play:

- Player is the square which starts out at the bottom of the screen
- The player moves the square with w,a,s,d keys
- The objective of the game is to move the square to the top of the screen and fill in the gap to complete the bar
- There are 5 levels
- Each level there is one ball moving around the screen and if the player collides with the ball the game is over
- Each level another ball is added
