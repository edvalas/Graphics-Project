####How to play

- Player is the square which starts out at the bottom of the screen
- The player moves the square with w,a,s,d keys
- The objective of the game is to move the square to the top of the screen and fill in the gap to complete the bar
- There are 5 levels
- Each level there is one ball or balls moving around the screen and if the player collides with the ball the game is over
- Each level another ball is added
- There is a restart button to reset the game if you completed the game or have collided with a ball

####Summary

The game is easy to play and understand, there are some minor bugs that occur sometimes. I spent most of the time trying to get the collisions to look as smooth as possible. The collision between the balls sometimes is not correct but very rarely. The collision between the player and the balls is sometimes perfect and sometimes a few pixels off. Overall the game works fine and is fun to play and can be quite challenging requiring quick reactions.
